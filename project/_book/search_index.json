The number of futures that are calculated is huge and data is saved in over 35 tables. The moset important tables include table of patients, hospitals, laboratory tests, etc. Most of the data are saved automatically but there are some futured that are entered manually according to care givers’ opinion. In this book, we first investigate the patient table since this table is the most important one and all other tables are connected to that. "],
["exploring-the-patient-table.html", "2 Exploring the patient table 2.1 Age 2.2 Gender 2.3 Ethnicity", " 2 Exploring the patient table The patient table is a core part of the eICU-CRD and contains all information related to tracking patient unit stays. The table also contains patient demographics and hospital-level information. The uniquePid column identifies a single patient across multiple stays. Let’s look at a single uniquepid. uniquepid gender age ethnicity hospitaldischargestatus 002-34851 Female 70 Caucasian Expired 002-33870 Female 52 Caucasian Alive 002-33870 Female 52 Caucasian Alive 002-5276 Male 68 Caucasian Alive 002-37665 Male 71 Caucasian Alive 002-37665 Male 71 Caucasian Alive Age, gender and ethnicity are the demographic factors of the patient’s table. We assume that people with age of more than 89 have 90 years old. Hospital discharge status is another important variable of the table. After leaving the hospital, patients are either dead or alive. We want to explore the relationship between the patient’s hospital discharge status and their demographic factors: 2.1 Age In this section, we can see the number of patient in different age category as well as their hospital discharge status. As you can see, most of the patients are alive but one should notice that the alive patients may go back to the hospital again. As we expected, by increasing age, mortality also increases. 2.2 Gender In this section, we want to compare the mortality rate in different Genders. As you can see, the rate of mortality in men is higher than women in very old and very young age. 2.3 Ethnicity Ethnicity is another important factor to study. The goal of studying the ethnicity is to know the number of patients at each category and their mortality ratio. As you can see, Caucasians and African American are the two biggest categories and include almost 90 % of the data. We will investigate these two categories further in third chapter to see their morality rate in different ages. "],
["racial-bias.html", "3 Racial Bias 3.1 Ethnicity-Mortality 3.2 Ethnicity-Mortality-Age", " 3 Racial Bias In this chapter, we first compare the mortality rate in different categories of ethnicity to make sure that all people receive the same care services. 3.1 Ethnicity-Mortality By comparing the mortality rate between different ethnicity categories, we can see that native American has the lowest mortality rate and Hispanic people have the highest. Among the 2 biggest categories, it is shown that they caucasian people have a slightly higher mortality rate in comparison to African American people. We will investigate this further to see at each age category they are different. 3.2 Ethnicity-Mortality-Age As we saw in chapter 2, Caucasians and African American are the two biggest groups in patients’ data. Figure below compares morality rate in black people versus white people in different age categories. Although the Caucasians people have slightely higher mortality rate than African Americans, we can see that at each age category, the rate of morality in black people is higher than white people. "],
